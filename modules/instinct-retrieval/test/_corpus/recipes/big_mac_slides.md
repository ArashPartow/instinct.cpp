## Ingredients

### Sliders
1 pound ground chuck
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
cooking spray
1 (12 ounce) package Hawaiian Sweet Dinner Rolls (such as King's Hawaiian)
1/3 cup Big Mac Sauce (recipe below)
6 (1/2 ounce each) American cheese slices
2/3 cup drained dill pickle chips
1/3 cup finely chopped yellow onion (from 1 small 5 ounce onion)
2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, melted
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 cup packed shredded iceberg lettuce (from 1 small [1 pound] head)

### Big Mac Sauce
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 1/2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt


## Directions

### Sliders
Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gather all ingredients.

Step 2
Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Press ground chuck into a thin, even 11- x 9-inch
rectangle on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle evenly with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
Step 3
Bake in preheated oven until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of beef registers 140°F to 145°F,
about 10 minutes. Using 2 large spatulas, transfer beef to a cutting board lined with paper towels; discard foil.
Step 4
Line same baking sheet with a new piece of foil; lightly coat with cooking spray. Using a serrated bread knife,
cut rolls in half horizontally, keeping top halves and bottom halves intact. Place the bottom half of rolls cutside up on prepared baking sheet.
Step 5
Spread Big Mac Sauce evenly over bottom half of rolls.
Step 6
Place beef patty over sauce, topping evenly with cheese slices, pickles, and onion.
Step 7
Place top half of rolls over pickles and onions. Brush tops and sides of rolls with melted butter, and sprinkle
evenly with sesame seeds.
Step 8
Bake in preheated oven until top buns are golden brown and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
Step 9
Carefully remove bun tops, sprinkle lettuce in an even layer, and replace bun tops.
Step 10
Cut sliders into 12 portions; serve with additional Big Mac Sauce.

### Sauce
Step 1
Whisk together all ingredients in a small bowl until fully combined. Chill in an airtight container for up to 5
days.
