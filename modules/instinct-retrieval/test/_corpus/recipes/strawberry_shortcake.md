## Ingredients

This strawberry shortcake is made entirely from scratch. However, you probably already have most of the ingredients in your pantry. If not, here's what you'll need to add to your grocery list:

1. Strawberries: Of course, a strawberry shortcake needs strawberries. This recipe calls for three pints of fresh strawberries.
Sugar: You'll use white sugar for both the strawberries and the shortcake.
2. Flour: This strawberry shortcake is made almost like biscuits, so you'll need 2 ¼ cups of all-purpose flour.
3. Baking Powder: Baking powder helps the shortcake rise.
4. Salt: Just a hint of salt adds a depth of flavor to the shortcake.
5. Shortening: Shortening is a classic shortcake ingredient, but reviewers say they've also had success using butter instead.
6. Egg: One egg binds the dough together.
7. Milk: Your milk of choice will keep the dough moist.
8. Whipped Heavy Cream: Homemade whipped cream tops this cake.


## How to Make Strawberry Shortcake

You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when making this strawberry shortcake.

1. Prep the berries: Slice the strawberries and cover them with white sugar.
2. Make the batter: Combine the dry ingredients, then cut in the shortening until the mixture is crumbly. Add the egg and milk and stir until combined.
3. Bake the cake: Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until golden brown.
5. Assemble the strawberry shortcake: Cut the cake in half. Top the bottom layer with half the strawberries, then replace the top of the cake. Top the cake with the remaining berries and whipped cream.


## Can You Make Strawberry Shortcake Ahead of Time?

Strawberry shortcake doesn't make great leftovers because after a few hours the shortcakes will be soggy.

Strawberry shortcake is best enjoyed immediately after assembling. So, if you want to prep the cake beforehand, you should bake the shortcake and then stop there. Wrap the shortcake in storage wrap and store in the fridge until you're ready to assemble it with the strawberries and whipped cream.
