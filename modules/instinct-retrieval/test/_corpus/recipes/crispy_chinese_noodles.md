# Crispy Chinese Noodles

Serve these crispy noodles with Chinese mustard and duck sauce as an appetizer, or use them as a garnish for soups. They're just like the ones you get at a Chinese restaurant. I love to sprinkle them over my egg-drop soup.

## Ingredients
1 (10 ounce) package egg roll wrappers

2 cups vegetable oil, or as needed

## Directions
Gather the ingredients.

Cut egg roll wrappers into 1-inch strips.

Heat a wok over medium heat until very hot. Pour oil into the hot wok and heat until shimmering. To test the heat, lower the tip of a wooden chopstick into the oil; if it bubbles vigorously, the oil is ready.

Gently place 2 to 3 strips into hot oil; cook until beginning to brown on one side, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Gently flip and cook until crisp and golden brown all over, 30 seconds to 1 minute more.

Use a slotted spoon to transfer fried strips to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat to fry remaining strips.

## From the Editor
We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. Amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used.
