## Ingredients
### Chicken Coating

1/4 cup cornstarch

1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce

1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1 pound skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces

Black Pepper Sauce

1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth

1/4 cup oyster sauce

2 tablespoons wine

2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce

1 tablespoon water

1 tablespoon cornstarch

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

### Stir Fry

3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided

1 tablespoon minced garlic

1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger

1 cup green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch pieces

1 cup white onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces

### For Serving

2 cups cooked white rice

## Directions

### Step 1 
Gather Ingredients.

### Step 2
For Chicken Coating, whisk together cornstarch, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and pepper in a large bowl. Mixture will be quite thick. Add chicken pieces to bowl; stir to coat chicken. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes.

### Step 3
Meanwhile, for Black Pepper Sauce, whisk together chicken broth, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, water, cornstarch, and pepper in a medium bowl.


### Step 4
Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add half the chicken. Cook and stir until lightly browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate; set aside. Repeat with remaining chicken. Remove chicken from skillet.

### Step 5
Add remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to skillet. Stir in minced garlic and ginger. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in bell pepper and onion. Cook and stir until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes.

### Step 6
Pour in Black Pepper Sauce and cook until sauce has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Return cooked chicken to skillet. Cook and stir until all ingredients are coated with sauce. Serve immediately over cooked white rice.
