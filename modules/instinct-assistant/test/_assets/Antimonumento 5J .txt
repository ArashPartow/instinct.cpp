During the night of 4 May 2020, Giovanni López (c. 1990 – 4 or 5 May 2020), a bricklayer, was arrested outside his family's house in the municipality of Ixtlahuacán de los Membrillos, Jalisco, by police officers for allegedly not wearing a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico and assaulting officers while resisting arrest. Giovanni's brother, Christian, recorded the arrest, which shows the officers taking him alive in the police van while insulting his family. Enrique Alfaro Ramírez, the state governor, had made the use of face masks mandatory.[2]

His brother contacted the mayor, Eduardo Cervantes, who asked them to pick Giovanni up the next day at the police station. There they were informed that Giovanni had been transferred to the Guadalajara Civil Hospital where they were notified of his death.[3] Giovanni died of a head trauma caused by a blunt object and had a gunshot in one leg.[2] The family complained to Cervantes who offered them Mex$200,000 (US$9,136)[4] to keep the video from being published. According to the family, they refused the payment and received death threats if the video was made public.[3][5]

On 25 May 2020, George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis, Minnesota, police officer in the United States. His death sparked protests in and outside the country, including Mexico, due to the persistent cases of police brutality.[6] After Floyd's murder, and inspired by the similar circumstances in which his brother died, Christian sent the video to the media on 1 June.[7] The video became viral and protests sparked on 4 June in Guadalajara, the capital city of Jalisco.[2] Demonstrators took to the streets of the historic center of the city, where they vandalized the State Government Palace and clashed with police officers, who repressed the protest with tear gas and arrested 26 people.[5] Alfaro (elected under the Citizens' Movement party) attributed the protests to the Federal Government and the Mexico City Government (both governed by the ruling National Regeneration Movement party), saying they sought to destabilize his government.[8] Alfaro added that Giovanni's arrest did not occur for not wearing a mask.[9] The police report indicated he was arrested due to an "administrative offense because he was aggressive with the security forces under the influence".[10]

The next day, demonstrators gathered to demand the release of the detainees. However, riot groups without their uniforms began arresting the protesters arbitrarily; witnesses said they used electric shocks and threatened to hand them over to the cartels. Officially, 16 people were arrested, but witnesses reported at least 80 arrests.[11] Alfaro said that some agents of the prosecutor's office were colluding with organized crime groups and that the agents involved disobeyed orders and acted on their own. The state arrested 11 agents because of it, according to the authorities.[8]

The following day, protesters occupied the streets, calling for the agents to free the demonstrators and provide an explanation of the whereabouts of up to 38 detainees who were reported as forcibly disappeared. Alfaro offered a public apology and ordered the release of all detainees,[12][13] though some of the detained had been abandoned on the edge of the city the previous night.[14] The event was baptized as the "Halconazo tapatío" referencing the 1971 massacre called "El Halconazo", as paramilitary groups without uniforms arbitrarily assassinated demonstrators in Mexico City.[15]
