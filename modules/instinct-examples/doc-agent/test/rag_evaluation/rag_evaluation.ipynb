They are used in various data science tasks such as image processing, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.\\n\\n> W&B are responsible for learning the patterns and relationships from the data by performing various operations such as training, backpropagation, and optimization. They help to extract these patterns and relationships to make predictions on new data inputs.\\n\\n> W&B are also responsible for setting the initial weights and biases of neural networks to determine their initial state. They are used in the training process to adjust the weights and biases to achieve better performance on the data.   \n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The name of the open-source library created by Hugging Face to simplify Transformer acceleration is not mentioned in the conversation, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.   \n65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Sure, here is the standalone question in its original language:\\n\\n> What is the parameter used to ensure that elements in a row have the same height in Gradio?   \n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The standalone question is about OpenVINO support for installation.

Patrick Esser and Robin Rombach and the Stability AI team.\\n\\nThe summary of the model is the following:, The literature on Diffusion-based models is developing at a rapid pace which is why we partnered with [Jonathan Whitaker](https://github.com/johnowhitaker) to develop a course on it. The course is free, and you can check it out [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class).\\n\\n## Support for third-party libraries, ## How does Stable Diffusion work?\\n\\nHaving seen the high-quality images that stable diffusion can produce, let's try to understand \\na bit better how the model functions.\\n\\nStable Diffusion is based on a particular type of diffusion model called **Latent Diffusion**, proposed in [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752).\\n\\nGenerally speaking, diffusion models are machine learning systems that are trained to *denoise* random Gaussian noise step by step, to get to a sample of interest, such as an *image*. For a more detailed overview of how they work, check [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/diffusers_intro.ipynb)., --\\ntitle: \"Finetune Stable Diffusion Models with DDPO via TRL\" \\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/166_trl_ddpo/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: metric-space\\n  guest: true\\n- user: sayakpaul\\n- user: kashif\\n- user: lvwerra\\n---\\n\\n# Finetune Stable Diffusion Models with DDPO via TRL\\n\\n\\n## Introduction, In this blog post, we discuss how DDPO came to be, a brief description of how it works, and how DDPO can be incorporated into an RLHF workflow to achieve model outputs more aligned with the human aesthetics. We then quickly switch gears to talk about how you can apply DDPO to your  models with the newly integrated `DDPOTrainer` from the `trl` library and discuss our findings from running DDPO on Stable Diffusion. \\n\\n## The Advantages of DDPO\\n\\nDDPO is not the only working answer to the question of how to attempt to fine-tune diffusion models with RL. \\n\\nBefore diving in, there are two key points to remember when it comes to understanding the advantages of one RL solution over the other\\n\\n1. Computational efficiency is key. The more complicated your data distribution gets, the higher your computational costs get.\\n2. Approximations are nice, but because approximations are not the real thing, associated errors stack up., We've gone from the basic use of Stable Diffusion using 🤗 Hugging Face Diffusers to more advanced uses of the library, and we tried to introduce all the pieces in a modern diffusion system.

For example, particularly relevant to this project, Hugging Face hosts model cards on the Hugging Face Hub as README files in the repositories associated with ML models. As a result, model cards figure as a prominent form of documentation for users of models on the Hugging Face Hub. As part of our analysis of model cards, we developed and proposed model cards for several dozen ML models on the Hugging Face Hub, using the Hub’s Pull Request (PR) and Discussion features to gather feedback on model cards, verify information included in model cards, and publish model cards for models on the Hugging Face Hub. At the time of writing of this guide book, all of Hugging Face’s models on the Hugging Face Hub have an associated model card on the Hub[^8]., --\\ntitle: Hugging Face Collaborates with Microsoft to launch Hugging Face Model Catalog on Azure\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/75_hugging_face_endpoints_on_azure/01.jpg\\nauthors:\\n- user: jeffboudier\\n- user: philschmid\\n- user: juliensimon\\n---\\n\\n# Hugging Face Collaborates with Microsoft to launch Hugging Face Model Catalog on Azure\\n\\n\\n![Hugging Face Endpoints on Azure](assets/75_hugging_face_endpoints_on_azure/01.jpg \"Hugging Face Endpoints on Azure\")]   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       [Datasets server API - rows endpoint\\n\\n> /rows endpoint\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\nThe service can be configured using environment variables.

Note that `config.attention_window` can be of type `List` to define a\\ndifferent \\\\(w\\\\) for each layer. A selected few tokens attend \"globally\" to all other tokens, as it is\\nconventionally done for all tokens in `BertSelfAttention`., ## Local attention\\n\\n[Longformer](#longformer) uses local attention: often, the local context (e.g., what are the two tokens to the\\nleft and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Also, by stacking attention layers that have a small\\nwindow, the last layer will have a receptive field of more than just the tokens in the window, allowing them to build a\\nrepresentation of the whole sentence.\\n\\nSome preselected input tokens are also given global attention: for those few tokens, the attention matrix can access\\nall tokens and this process is symmetric: all other tokens have access to those specific tokens (on top of the ones in\\ntheir local window). This is shown in Figure 2d of the paper, see below for a sample attention mask:, - [`LongT5ForConditionalGeneration`] is an extension of [`T5ForConditionalGeneration`] exchanging the traditional\\nencoder *self-attention* layer with efficient either *local* attention or *transient-global* (*tglobal*) attention.\\n- Unlike the T5 model, LongT5 does not use a task prefix. Furthermore, it uses a different pre-training objective\\ninspired by the pre-training of [`PegasusForConditionalGeneration`].\\n- LongT5 model is designed to work efficiently and very well on long-range *sequence-to-sequence* tasks where the\\ninput sequence exceeds commonly used 512 tokens. It is capable of handling input sequences of a length up to 16,384 tokens.\\n- For *Local Attention*, the sparse sliding-window local attention operation allows a given token to attend only `r`, Note that \"locally\" and \"globally\" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note\\nthat every \"locally\" attending token not only attends to tokens within its window \\\\(w\\\\), but also to all \"globally\"\\nattending tokens so that global attention is *symmetric*.\\n\\nThe user can define which tokens attend \"locally\" and which tokens attend \"globally\" by setting the tensor\\n`global_attention_mask` at run-time appropriately. All Longformer models employ the following logic for\\n`global_attention_mask`:\\n\\n- 0: the token attends \"locally\",\\n- 1: the token attends \"globally\".\\n\\nFor more information please also refer to [`~LongformerModel.forward`] method., are constructed dynamically within each attention operation).  As a consequence, *TGlobal* attention introduces\\na few new parameters -- global relative position biases and a layer normalization for global token's embedding.\\nThe complexity of this mechanism is `O(l(r + l/k))`.\\n- An example showing how to evaluate a fine-tuned LongT5 model on the [pubmed dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/scientific_papers) is below., -->\\n\\n# LongT5\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe LongT5 model was proposed in [LongT5: Efficient Text-To-Text Transformer for Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07916)\\nby Mandy Guo, Joshua Ainslie, David Uthus, Santiago Ontanon, Jianmo Ni, Yun-Hsuan Sung and Yinfei Yang. It's an\\nencoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting. LongT5 model is an extension of\\nT5 model, and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2)\\nTransient-Global attention.\\n\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:, However, most Transformer models continued to trend towards more parameters, leading to new models focused on improving training efficiency. [ALBERT](model_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths. It uses a combination of local windowed attention (attention only calculated from fixed window size around each token) and global attention (only for specific task tokens like `[CLS]` for classification) to create a sparse attention matrix instead of a full attention matrix.\\n\\n### Decoder[[nlp-decoder]]]   \n..

The course is free, and you can check it out [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class).\\n\\n## Support for third-party libraries, ## How does Stable Diffusion work?\\n\\nHaving seen the high-quality images that stable diffusion can produce, let's try to understand \\na bit better how the model functions.\\n\\nStable Diffusion is based on a particular type of diffusion model called **Latent Diffusion**, proposed in [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752).\\n\\nGenerally speaking, diffusion models are machine learning systems that are trained to *denoise* random Gaussian noise step by step, to get to a sample of interest, such as an *image*.

We then quickly switch gears to talk about how you can apply DDPO to your  models with the newly integrated `DDPOTrainer` from the `trl` library and discuss our findings from running DDPO on Stable Diffusion. \\n\\n## The Advantages of DDPO\\n\\nDDPO is not the only working answer to the question of how to attempt to fine-tune diffusion models with RL. \\n\\nBefore diving in, there are two key points to remember when it comes to understanding the advantages of one RL solution over the other\\n\\n1. Computational efficiency is key. The more complicated your data distribution gets, the higher your computational costs get.\\n2. Approximations are nice, but because approximations are not the real thing, associated errors stack up., We've gone from the basic use of Stable Diffusion using 🤗 Hugging Face Diffusers to more advanced uses of the library, and we tried to introduce all the pieces in a modern diffusion system.

For example, particularly relevant to this project, Hugging Face hosts model cards on the Hugging Face Hub as README files in the repositories associated with ML models. As a result, model cards figure as a prominent form of documentation for users of models on the Hugging Face Hub. As part of our analysis of model cards, we developed and proposed model cards for several dozen ML models on the Hugging Face Hub, using the Hub’s Pull Request (PR) and Discussion features to gather feedback on model cards, verify information included in model cards, and publish model cards for models on the Hugging Face Hub. At the time of writing of this guide book, all of Hugging Face’s models on the Hugging Face Hub have an associated model card on the Hub[^8]., --\\ntitle: Hugging Face Collaborates with Microsoft to launch Hugging Face Model Catalog on Azure\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/75_hugging_face_endpoints_on_azure/01.jpg\\nauthors:\\n- user: jeffboudier\\n- user: philschmid\\n- user: juliensimon\\n---\\n\\n# Hugging Face Collaborates with Microsoft to launch Hugging Face Model Catalog on Azure\\n\\n\\n![Hugging Face Endpoints on Azure](assets/75_hugging_face_endpoints_on_azure/01.jpg \"Hugging Face Endpoints on Azure\")]</td>\n      <td>langchain_chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b_embedding-model:all-minilm</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>The response is largely correct and accurately describes the process of claiming authorship on the Hugging Face Hub.

Most tokens only\\nattend \"locally\" to each other meaning that each token attends to its \\\\(\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) previous tokens and\\n\\\\(\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) succeeding tokens with \\\\(w\\\\) being the window length as defined in\\n`config.attention_window`. Note that `config.attention_window` can be of type `List` to define a\\ndifferent \\\\(w\\\\) for each layer. A selected few tokens attend \"globally\" to all other tokens, as it is\\nconventionally done for all tokens in `BertSelfAttention`., ## Local attention\\n\\n[Longformer](#longformer) uses local attention: often, the local context (e.g., what are the two tokens to the\\nleft and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Also, by stacking attention layers that have a small\\nwindow, the last layer will have a receptive field of more than just the tokens in the window, allowing them to build a\\nrepresentation of the whole sentence.\\n\\nSome preselected input tokens are also given global attention: for those few tokens, the attention matrix can access\\nall tokens and this process is symmetric: all other tokens have access to those specific tokens (on top of the ones in\\ntheir local window). This is shown in Figure 2d of the paper, see below for a sample attention mask:, - [`LongT5ForConditionalGeneration`] is an extension of [`T5ForConditionalGeneration`] exchanging the traditional\\nencoder *self-attention* layer with efficient either *local* attention or *transient-global* (*tglobal*) attention.\\n- Unlike the T5 model, LongT5 does not use a task prefix. Furthermore, it uses a different pre-training objective\\ninspired by the pre-training of [`PegasusForConditionalGeneration`].\\n- LongT5 model is designed to work efficiently and very well on long-range *sequence-to-sequence* tasks where the\\ninput sequence exceeds commonly used 512 tokens. It is capable of handling input sequences of a length up to 16,384 tokens.\\n- For *Local Attention*, the sparse sliding-window local attention operation allows a given token to attend only `r`, Note that \"locally\" and \"globally\" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note\\nthat every \"locally\" attending token not only attends to tokens within its window \\\\(w\\\\), but also to all \"globally\"\\nattending tokens so that global attention is *symmetric*.\\n\\nThe user can define which tokens attend \"locally\" and which tokens attend \"globally\" by setting the tensor\\n`global_attention_mask` at run-time appropriately. All Longformer models employ the following logic for\\n`global_attention_mask`:\\n\\n- 0: the token attends \"locally\",\\n- 1: the token attends \"globally\".\\n\\nFor more information please also refer to [`~LongformerModel.forward`] method., are constructed dynamically within each attention operation).  As a consequence, *TGlobal* attention introduces\\na few new parameters -- global relative position biases and a layer normalization for global token's embedding.\\nThe complexity of this mechanism is `O(l(r + l/k))`.\\n- An example showing how to evaluate a fine-tuned LongT5 model on the [pubmed dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/scientific_papers) is below., --&gt;\\n\\n# LongT5\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe LongT5 model was proposed in [LongT5: Efficient Text-To-Text Transformer for Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07916)\\nby Mandy Guo, Joshua Ainslie, David Uthus, Santiago Ontanon, Jianmo Ni, Yun-Hsuan Sung and Yinfei Yang. It's an\\nencoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting. LongT5 model is an extension of\\nT5 model, and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2)\\nTransient-Global attention.\\n\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:, However, most Transformer models continued to trend towards more parameters, leading to new models focused on improving training efficiency. [ALBERT](model_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths. It uses a combination of local windowed attention (attention only calculated from fixed window size around each token) and global attention (only for specific task tokens like `[CLS]` for classification) to create a sparse attention matrix instead of a full attention matrix.\\n\\n### Decoder[[nlp-decoder]]]</td>\n      <td>langchain_chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b_embedding-model:all-minilm</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>The response correctly indicates that the context does not provide enough information to answer the question, which aligns with the instruction's requirement for a factual answer based on the context.
