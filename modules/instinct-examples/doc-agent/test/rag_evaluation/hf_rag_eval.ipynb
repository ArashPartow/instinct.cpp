Diffusion Announcement](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-announcement) by Patrick Esser and Robin Rombach and the Stability AI team.\\n\\nThe summary of the model is the following:, The literature on Diffusion-based models is developing at a rapid pace which is why we partnered with [Jonathan Whitaker](https://github.com/johnowhitaker) to develop a course on it. The course is free, and you can check it out [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class).\\n\\n## Support for third-party libraries, ## How does Stable Diffusion work?\\n\\nHaving seen the high-quality images that stable diffusion can produce, let's try to understand \\na bit better how the model functions.\\n\\nStable Diffusion is based on a particular type of diffusion model called **Latent Diffusion**, proposed in [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752).\\n\\nGenerally speaking, diffusion models are machine learning systems that are trained to *denoise* random Gaussian noise step by step, to get to a sample of interest, such as an *image*. For a more detailed overview of how they work, check [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/diffusers_intro.ipynb)., --\\ntitle: \"Finetune Stable Diffusion Models with DDPO via TRL\" \\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/166_trl_ddpo/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: metric-space\\n  guest: true\\n- user: sayakpaul\\n- user: kashif\\n- user: lvwerra\\n---\\n\\n# Finetune Stable Diffusion Models with DDPO via TRL\\n\\n\\n## Introduction, In this blog post, we discuss how DDPO came to be, a brief description of how it works, and how DDPO can be incorporated into an RLHF workflow to achieve model outputs more aligned with the human aesthetics. We then quickly switch gears to talk about how you can apply DDPO to your  models with the newly integrated `DDPOTrainer` from the `trl` library and discuss our findings from running DDPO on Stable Diffusion. \\n\\n## The Advantages of DDPO\\n\\nDDPO is not the only working answer to the question of how to attempt to fine-tune diffusion models with RL. \\n\\nBefore diving in, there are two key points to remember when it comes to understanding the advantages of one RL solution over the other\\n\\n1. Computational efficiency is key. The more complicated your data distribution gets, the higher your computational costs get.\\n2. Approximations are nice, but because approximations are not the real thing, associated errors stack up., We've gone from the basic use of Stable Diffusion using 🤗 Hugging Face Diffusers to more advanced uses of the library, and we tried to introduce all the pieces in a modern diffusion system.

For example, particularly relevant to this project, Hugging Face hosts model cards on the Hugging Face Hub as README files in the repositories associated with ML models. As a result, model cards figure as a prominent form of documentation for users of models on the Hugging Face Hub. As part of our analysis of model cards, we developed and proposed model cards for several dozen ML models on the Hugging Face Hub, using the Hub’s Pull Request (PR) and Discussion features to gather feedback on model cards, verify information included in model cards, and publish model cards for models on the Hugging Face Hub. At the time of writing of this guide book, all of Hugging Face’s models on the Hugging Face Hub have an associated model card on the Hub[^8]., --\\ntitle: Hugging Face Collaborates with Microsoft to launch Hugging Face Model Catalog on Azure\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/75_hugging_face_endpoints_on_azure/01.jpg\\nauthors:\\n- user: jeffboudier\\n- user: philschmid\\n- user: juliensimon\\n---\\n\\n# Hugging Face Collaborates with Microsoft to launch Hugging Face Model Catalog on Azure\\n\\n\\n![Hugging Face Endpoints on Azure](assets/75_hugging_face_endpoints_on_azure/01.jpg \"Hugging Face Endpoints on Azure\")]   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   [Datasets server API - rows endpoint\\n\\n> /rows endpoint\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\nThe service can be configured using environment variables.

Most tokens only\\nattend \"locally\" to each other meaning that each token attends to its \\\\(\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) previous tokens and\\n\\\\(\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) succeeding tokens with \\\\(w\\\\) being the window length as defined in\\n`config.attention_window`. Note that `config.attention_window` can be of type `List` to define a\\ndifferent \\\\(w\\\\) for each layer. A selected few tokens attend \"globally\" to all other tokens, as it is\\nconventionally done for all tokens in `BertSelfAttention`., ## Local attention\\n\\n[Longformer](#longformer) uses local attention: often, the local context (e.g., what are the two tokens to the\\nleft and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Also, by stacking attention layers that have a small\\nwindow, the last layer will have a receptive field of more than just the tokens in the window, allowing them to build a\\nrepresentation of the whole sentence.\\n\\nSome preselected input tokens are also given global attention: for those few tokens, the attention matrix can access\\nall tokens and this process is symmetric: all other tokens have access to those specific tokens (on top of the ones in\\ntheir local window). This is shown in Figure 2d of the paper, see below for a sample attention mask:, - [`LongT5ForConditionalGeneration`] is an extension of [`T5ForConditionalGeneration`] exchanging the traditional\\nencoder *self-attention* layer with efficient either *local* attention or *transient-global* (*tglobal*) attention.\\n- Unlike the T5 model, LongT5 does not use a task prefix. Furthermore, it uses a different pre-training objective\\ninspired by the pre-training of [`PegasusForConditionalGeneration`].\\n- LongT5 model is designed to work efficiently and very well on long-range *sequence-to-sequence* tasks where the\\ninput sequence exceeds commonly used 512 tokens. It is capable of handling input sequences of a length up to 16,384 tokens.\\n- For *Local Attention*, the sparse sliding-window local attention operation allows a given token to attend only `r`, Note that \"locally\" and \"globally\" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note\\nthat every \"locally\" attending token not only attends to tokens within its window \\\\(w\\\\), but also to all \"globally\"\\nattending tokens so that global attention is *symmetric*.\\n\\nThe user can define which tokens attend \"locally\" and which tokens attend \"globally\" by setting the tensor\\n`global_attention_mask` at run-time appropriately. All Longformer models employ the following logic for\\n`global_attention_mask`:\\n\\n- 0: the token attends \"locally\",\\n- 1: the token attends \"globally\".\\n\\nFor more information please also refer to [`~LongformerModel.forward`] method., are constructed dynamically within each attention operation).  As a consequence, *TGlobal* attention introduces\\na few new parameters -- global relative position biases and a layer normalization for global token's embedding.\\nThe complexity of this mechanism is `O(l(r + l/k))`.\\n- An example showing how to evaluate a fine-tuned LongT5 model on the [pubmed dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/scientific_papers) is below., -->\\n\\n# LongT5\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe LongT5 model was proposed in [LongT5: Efficient Text-To-Text Transformer for Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07916)\\nby Mandy Guo, Joshua Ainslie, David Uthus, Santiago Ontanon, Jianmo Ni, Yun-Hsuan Sung and Yinfei Yang. It's an\\nencoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting. LongT5 model is an extension of\\nT5 model, and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2)\\nTransient-Global attention.\\n\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:, However, most Transformer models continued to trend towards more parameters, leading to new models focused on improving training efficiency. [ALBERT](model_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths. It uses a combination of local windowed attention (attention only calculated from fixed window size around each token) and global attention (only for specific task tokens like `[CLS]` for classification) to create a sparse attention matrix instead of a full attention matrix.\\n\\n### Decoder[[nlp-decoder]]]   \n..

                                                       [## Sharded checkpoints\\n\\nSince version 4.18.0, model checkpoints that end up taking more than 10GB of space are automatically sharded in smaller pieces. In terms of having one single checkpoint when you do `model.save_pretrained(save_dir)`, you will end up with several partial checkpoints (each of which being of size < 10GB) and an index that maps parameter names to the files they are stored in.\\n\\nYou can control the maximum size before sharding with the `max_shard_size` parameter, so for the sake of an example, we'll use a normal-size models with a small shard size: let's take a traditional BERT model.\\n\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import AutoModel\\n\\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\\n```\\n\\nIf you save it using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], you will get a new folder with two files: the config of the model and its weights:, ```py\\n>>> index[\"weight_map\"]\\n{'embeddings.LayerNorm.bias': 'pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin',\\n 'embeddings.LayerNorm.weight': 'pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin',\\n ...\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to directly load such a sharded checkpoint inside a model without using [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] (like you would do `model.load_state_dict()` for a full checkpoint) you should use [`~modeling_utils.load_sharded_checkpoint`]:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> from transformers.modeling_utils import load_sharded_checkpoint\\n\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\\n...     model.save_pretrained(tmp_dir, max_shard_size=\"200MB\")\\n...     load_sharded_checkpoint(model, tmp_dir)\\n```\\n\\n## Low memory loading, <Tip>\\n\\nNote that the randomly created model is initialized with \"empty\" tensors, which take the space in memory without filling it (thus the random values are whatever was in this chunk of memory at a given time). The random initialization following the appropriate distribution for the kind of model/parameters instantiated (like a normal distribution for instance) is only performed after step 3 on the non-initialized weights, to be as fast as possible! \\n\\n</Tip>\\n\\nIn this guide, we explore the solutions Transformers offer to deal with this issue. Note that this is an area of active development, so the APIs explained here may change slightly in the future.\\n\\n## Sharded checkpoints, ## Low memory loading\\n\\nSharded checkpoints reduce the memory usage during step 2 of the workflow mentioned above, but in order to use that model in a low memory setting, we recommend leveraging our tools based on the Accelerate library.\\n\\nPlease read the following guide for more information: [Large model loading using Accelerate](./main_classes/model#large-model-loading), ## Checkpoint Naming\\n\\n* CodeGen model [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?other=codegen) are available on different pre-training data with variable sizes.\\n* The format is: `Salesforce/codegen-{size}-{data}`, where\\n  * `size`: `350M`, `2B`, `6B`, `16B`\\n  * `data`: \\n    * `nl`: Pre-trained on the Pile\\n    * `multi`: Initialized with `nl`, then further pre-trained on multiple programming languages data\\n    * `mono`: Initialized with `multi`, then further pre-trained on Python data\\n* For example, `Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono` offers a 350 million-parameter checkpoint pre-trained sequentially on the Pile, multiple programming languages, and Python.\\n\\n## Usage example\\n\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, performing masked image modeling. You can find it [here](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/BEiT).\\n- As the BEiT models expect each image to be of the same size (resolution), one can use\\n  [`BeitImageProcessor`] to resize (or rescale) and normalize images for the model.\\n- Both the patch resolution and image resolution used during pre-training or fine-tuning are reflected in the name of\\n  each checkpoint. For example, `microsoft/beit-base-patch16-224` refers to a base-sized architecture with patch\\n  resolution of 16x16 and fine-tuning resolution of 224x224. All checkpoints can be found on the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=microsoft/beit)., In the following, we try to give you a general recipe that we found most\\nuseful when porting a model to 🤗 Transformers.\\n\\nThe following list is a summary of everything that has to be done to add\\na model and can be used by you as a To-Do List:\\n\\n1.

The first part is a broader reflection on bias and its context. If you’ve already read it and are coming back specifically for the tools, feel free to jump to the [datasets](#i-am-curatingpicking-a-dataset-for-my-ml-system-how-can-i-address-bias) or [models](#i-am-trainingselecting-a-model-for-my-ml-system-how-can-i-address-bias)\\nsection!_, In the next section, we review these various stages along with some of the tools that can help us address machine bias at each of them.\\n\\n\\n## Addressing Bias throughout the ML Development Cycle\\n\\nReady for some practical advice yet? Here we go 🤗\\n\\nThere is no one single way to develop ML systems; which steps happen in what order depends on a number of factors including the development setting (university, large company, startup, grassroots organization, etc…), the modality (text, tabular data, images, etc…), and the preeminence or scarcity of publicly available ML resources. However, we can identify three common stages of particular interest in addressing bias. These are the task definition, the data curation, and the model training. Let’s have a look at how bias handling may differ across these various stages., ## Putting Bias in Context\\n\\nThe first and maybe most important concept to consider when dealing with machine bias is **context**. In their foundational work on [bias in NLP](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.485.pdf), Su Lin Blodgett et al. point out that: _“[T]he majority of [academic works on machine bias] fail to engage critically with what constitutes “bias” in the first place”_, including by building their work on top of _“unstated assumptions about what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why”_., #### Task definition: recommendations\\n\\nThere are as many ways for the ML task definition and deployment to affect the risk of bias-related harms as there are applications for ML systems. As in the examples above, some common steps that may help decide whether and how to apply ML in a way that minimizes bias-related risk include:\\n\\n\\n\\n* Investigate:\\n    * Reports of bias in the field pre-ML\\n    * At-risk demographic categories for your specific use case\\n* Examine:\\n    * The impact of your optimization objective on reinforcing biases\\n    * Alternative objectives that favor diversity and positive long-term impacts\\n\\n\\n### I am <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">curating/picking a dataset</span> for my ML system, how can I address bias?, So, who’s on the hook for machine biases in ML? These three cases illustrate one of the reasons why discussions about the responsibility of ML developers in addressing bias can get so complicated: depending on decisions made at other points in the ML system development process by other people, the biases in an ML dataset or model may land anywhere between being irrelevant to the application settings and directly leading to grievous harm. However, in all of these cases, **stronger biases in the model/dataset increase the risk of negative outcomes**. The European Union has started to develop frameworks that address this phenomenon in [recent regulatory efforts](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/doing-business-eu/contract-rules/digital-contracts/liability-rules-artificial-intelligence_en): in short, a company that deploys an AI system based on a measurably biased model is liable for harm caused by the system., Conceptualizing bias as a risk factor then allows us to better understand the **shared responsibility** for machine biases between developers at all stages. Bias can never be fully removed, not least because the definitions of social biases and the power dynamics that tie them to discrimination vary vastly across social contexts. However:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Each stage of the development process, from task specification, dataset curation, and model training, to model integration and system deployment, can take steps to minimize the aspects of machine bias** that most directly depend on its choices** and technical decisions, and\\n2. Clear communication and **information flow between the various ML development stages** can make the difference between making choices that build on top of each other to attenuate the negative potential of bias (multipronged approach to bias mitigation, as in deployment scenario 1 above) _versus_ making choices that compound this negative potential to exacerbate the risk of harm (as in deployment scenario 3).]   \n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      [Last July, we [announced](https://huggingface.co/blog/intel) that Intel and Hugging Face would collaborate on building state-of-the-art yet simple hardware acceleration tools for Transformer models. \\n​, 1. **[Reformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/reformer)** (from Google Research) released with the paper [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) by Nikita Kitaev, Łukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya., The Hugging Face Course\\n\\nThis repo contains the content that's used to create the **[Hugging Face course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1)**.

These parameters accept either a number (interpreted as pixels) or a string. Using a string allows the direct application of any CSS unit to the encapsulating Block element, catering to more specifc design requirements.

Static quantization can also be applied on the activations using [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf), more information can be found in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/intel/optimization_ov)., | [How to run inference with OpenVINO](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/notebooks/openvino/optimum_openvino_inference.ipynb) | Explains how to export your model to OpenVINO and run inference with OpenVINO Runtime on various tasks| [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/notebooks/openvino/optimum_openvino_inference.ipynb)| [![Open in AWS Studio](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/notebooks/openvino/optimum_openvino_inference.ipynb)|, ## Optimum Intel\\n\\n### OpenVINO]   \n\n                                   test_settings eval_score_None  \\\n0   chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b               3   \n1   chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b               1   \n2   chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b               3   \n3   chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b               4   \n4   chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b               1   \n..                                           ...             ...   \n62  chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b               5   \n63  chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b               4   \n64  chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b               1   \n65  chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b               1   \n66  chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b             NaN   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 eval_feedback_None  \\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Feedback: The response is somewhat correct, accurate, and factual.   \n1                                                                                                     Feedback: The response is not correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.

We then quickly switch gears to talk about how you can apply DDPO to your  models with the newly integrated `DDPOTrainer` from the `trl` library and discuss our findings from running DDPO on Stable Diffusion. \\n\\n## The Advantages of DDPO\\n\\nDDPO is not the only working answer to the question of how to attempt to fine-tune diffusion models with RL. \\n\\nBefore diving in, there are two key points to remember when it comes to understanding the advantages of one RL solution over the other\\n\\n1. Computational efficiency is key. The more complicated your data distribution gets, the higher your computational costs get.\\n2. Approximations are nice, but because approximations are not the real thing, associated errors stack up., We've gone from the basic use of Stable Diffusion using 🤗 Hugging Face Diffusers to more advanced uses of the library, and we tried to introduce all the pieces in a modern diffusion system.

For example, particularly relevant to this project, Hugging Face hosts model cards on the Hugging Face Hub as README files in the repositories associated with ML models. As a result, model cards figure as a prominent form of documentation for users of models on the Hugging Face Hub. As part of our analysis of model cards, we developed and proposed model cards for several dozen ML models on the Hugging Face Hub, using the Hub’s Pull Request (PR) and Discussion features to gather feedback on model cards, verify information included in model cards, and publish model cards for models on the Hugging Face Hub. At the time of writing of this guide book, all of Hugging Face’s models on the Hugging Face Hub have an associated model card on the Hub[^8]., --\\ntitle: Hugging Face Collaborates with Microsoft to launch Hugging Face Model Catalog on Azure\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/75_hugging_face_endpoints_on_azure/01.jpg\\nauthors:\\n- user: jeffboudier\\n- user: philschmid\\n- user: juliensimon\\n---\\n\\n# Hugging Face Collaborates with Microsoft to launch Hugging Face Model Catalog on Azure\\n\\n\\n![Hugging Face Endpoints on Azure](assets/75_hugging_face_endpoints_on_azure/01.jpg \"Hugging Face Endpoints on Azure\")]</td>\n      <td>chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>Feedback: The response is somewhat correct, accurate, and factual.

Most tokens only\\nattend \"locally\" to each other meaning that each token attends to its \\\\(\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) previous tokens and\\n\\\\(\\frac{1}{2} w\\\\) succeeding tokens with \\\\(w\\\\) being the window length as defined in\\n`config.attention_window`. Note that `config.attention_window` can be of type `List` to define a\\ndifferent \\\\(w\\\\) for each layer. A selected few tokens attend \"globally\" to all other tokens, as it is\\nconventionally done for all tokens in `BertSelfAttention`., ## Local attention\\n\\n[Longformer](#longformer) uses local attention: often, the local context (e.g., what are the two tokens to the\\nleft and right?) is enough to take action for a given token. Also, by stacking attention layers that have a small\\nwindow, the last layer will have a receptive field of more than just the tokens in the window, allowing them to build a\\nrepresentation of the whole sentence.\\n\\nSome preselected input tokens are also given global attention: for those few tokens, the attention matrix can access\\nall tokens and this process is symmetric: all other tokens have access to those specific tokens (on top of the ones in\\ntheir local window). This is shown in Figure 2d of the paper, see below for a sample attention mask:, - [`LongT5ForConditionalGeneration`] is an extension of [`T5ForConditionalGeneration`] exchanging the traditional\\nencoder *self-attention* layer with efficient either *local* attention or *transient-global* (*tglobal*) attention.\\n- Unlike the T5 model, LongT5 does not use a task prefix. Furthermore, it uses a different pre-training objective\\ninspired by the pre-training of [`PegasusForConditionalGeneration`].\\n- LongT5 model is designed to work efficiently and very well on long-range *sequence-to-sequence* tasks where the\\ninput sequence exceeds commonly used 512 tokens. It is capable of handling input sequences of a length up to 16,384 tokens.\\n- For *Local Attention*, the sparse sliding-window local attention operation allows a given token to attend only `r`, Note that \"locally\" and \"globally\" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note\\nthat every \"locally\" attending token not only attends to tokens within its window \\\\(w\\\\), but also to all \"globally\"\\nattending tokens so that global attention is *symmetric*.\\n\\nThe user can define which tokens attend \"locally\" and which tokens attend \"globally\" by setting the tensor\\n`global_attention_mask` at run-time appropriately. All Longformer models employ the following logic for\\n`global_attention_mask`:\\n\\n- 0: the token attends \"locally\",\\n- 1: the token attends \"globally\".\\n\\nFor more information please also refer to [`~LongformerModel.forward`] method., are constructed dynamically within each attention operation).  As a consequence, *TGlobal* attention introduces\\na few new parameters -- global relative position biases and a layer normalization for global token's embedding.\\nThe complexity of this mechanism is `O(l(r + l/k))`.\\n- An example showing how to evaluate a fine-tuned LongT5 model on the [pubmed dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/scientific_papers) is below., --&gt;\\n\\n# LongT5\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe LongT5 model was proposed in [LongT5: Efficient Text-To-Text Transformer for Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07916)\\nby Mandy Guo, Joshua Ainslie, David Uthus, Santiago Ontanon, Jianmo Ni, Yun-Hsuan Sung and Yinfei Yang. It's an\\nencoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting. LongT5 model is an extension of\\nT5 model, and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2)\\nTransient-Global attention.\\n\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:, However, most Transformer models continued to trend towards more parameters, leading to new models focused on improving training efficiency. [ALBERT](model_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths. It uses a combination of local windowed attention (attention only calculated from fixed window size around each token) and global attention (only for specific task tokens like `[CLS]` for classification) to create a sparse attention matrix instead of a full attention matrix.\\n\\n### Decoder[[nlp-decoder]]]</td>\n      <td>chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Feedback: The response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual based on the reference answer.

In terms of having one single checkpoint when you do `model.save_pretrained(save_dir)`, you will end up with several partial checkpoints (each of which being of size &lt; 10GB) and an index that maps parameter names to the files they are stored in.\\n\\nYou can control the maximum size before sharding with the `max_shard_size` parameter, so for the sake of an example, we'll use a normal-size models with a small shard size: let's take a traditional BERT model.\\n\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import AutoModel\\n\\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\\n```\\n\\nIf you save it using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], you will get a new folder with two files: the config of the model and its weights:, ```py\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; index[\"weight_map\"]\\n{'embeddings.LayerNorm.bias': 'pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin',\\n 'embeddings.LayerNorm.weight': 'pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin',\\n ...\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to directly load such a sharded checkpoint inside a model without using [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] (like you would do `model.load_state_dict()` for a full checkpoint) you should use [`~modeling_utils.load_sharded_checkpoint`]:\\n\\n```py\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers.modeling_utils import load_sharded_checkpoint\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\\n...     model.save_pretrained(tmp_dir, max_shard_size=\"200MB\")\\n...     load_sharded_checkpoint(model, tmp_dir)\\n```\\n\\n## Low memory loading, &lt;Tip&gt;\\n\\nNote that the randomly created model is initialized with \"empty\" tensors, which take the space in memory without filling it (thus the random values are whatever was in this chunk of memory at a given time). The random initialization following the appropriate distribution for the kind of model/parameters instantiated (like a normal distribution for instance) is only performed after step 3 on the non-initialized weights, to be as fast as possible! \\n\\n&lt;/Tip&gt;\\n\\nIn this guide, we explore the solutions Transformers offer to deal with this issue. Note that this is an area of active development, so the APIs explained here may change slightly in the future.\\n\\n## Sharded checkpoints, ## Low memory loading\\n\\nSharded checkpoints reduce the memory usage during step 2 of the workflow mentioned above, but in order to use that model in a low memory setting, we recommend leveraging our tools based on the Accelerate library.\\n\\nPlease read the following guide for more information: [Large model loading using Accelerate](./main_classes/model#large-model-loading), ## Checkpoint Naming\\n\\n* CodeGen model [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?other=codegen) are available on different pre-training data with variable sizes.\\n* The format is: `Salesforce/codegen-{size}-{data}`, where\\n  * `size`: `350M`, `2B`, `6B`, `16B`\\n  * `data`: \\n    * `nl`: Pre-trained on the Pile\\n    * `multi`: Initialized with `nl`, then further pre-trained on multiple programming languages data\\n    * `mono`: Initialized with `multi`, then further pre-trained on Python data\\n* For example, `Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono` offers a 350 million-parameter checkpoint pre-trained sequentially on the Pile, multiple programming languages, and Python.\\n\\n## Usage example\\n\\n```python\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, performing masked image modeling. You can find it [here](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/BEiT).\\n- As the BEiT models expect each image to be of the same size (resolution), one can use\\n  [`BeitImageProcessor`] to resize (or rescale) and normalize images for the model.\\n- Both the patch resolution and image resolution used during pre-training or fine-tuning are reflected in the name of\\n  each checkpoint.

The first part is a broader reflection on bias and its context. If you’ve already read it and are coming back specifically for the tools, feel free to jump to the [datasets](#i-am-curatingpicking-a-dataset-for-my-ml-system-how-can-i-address-bias) or [models](#i-am-trainingselecting-a-model-for-my-ml-system-how-can-i-address-bias)\\nsection!_, In the next section, we review these various stages along with some of the tools that can help us address machine bias at each of them.\\n\\n\\n## Addressing Bias throughout the ML Development Cycle\\n\\nReady for some practical advice yet? Here we go 🤗\\n\\nThere is no one single way to develop ML systems; which steps happen in what order depends on a number of factors including the development setting (university, large company, startup, grassroots organization, etc…), the modality (text, tabular data, images, etc…), and the preeminence or scarcity of publicly available ML resources. However, we can identify three common stages of particular interest in addressing bias. These are the task definition, the data curation, and the model training. Let’s have a look at how bias handling may differ across these various stages., ## Putting Bias in Context\\n\\nThe first and maybe most important concept to consider when dealing with machine bias is **context**. In their foundational work on [bias in NLP](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.485.pdf), Su Lin Blodgett et al. point out that: _“[T]he majority of [academic works on machine bias] fail to engage critically with what constitutes “bias” in the first place”_, including by building their work on top of _“unstated assumptions about what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why”_., #### Task definition: recommendations\\n\\nThere are as many ways for the ML task definition and deployment to affect the risk of bias-related harms as there are applications for ML systems. As in the examples above, some common steps that may help decide whether and how to apply ML in a way that minimizes bias-related risk include:\\n\\n\\n\\n* Investigate:\\n    * Reports of bias in the field pre-ML\\n    * At-risk demographic categories for your specific use case\\n* Examine:\\n    * The impact of your optimization objective on reinforcing biases\\n    * Alternative objectives that favor diversity and positive long-term impacts\\n\\n\\n### I am &lt;span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"&gt;curating/picking a dataset&lt;/span&gt; for my ML system, how can I address bias?, So, who’s on the hook for machine biases in ML? These three cases illustrate one of the reasons why discussions about the responsibility of ML developers in addressing bias can get so complicated: depending on decisions made at other points in the ML system development process by other people, the biases in an ML dataset or model may land anywhere between being irrelevant to the application settings and directly leading to grievous harm. However, in all of these cases, **stronger biases in the model/dataset increase the risk of negative outcomes**. The European Union has started to develop frameworks that address this phenomenon in [recent regulatory efforts](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/doing-business-eu/contract-rules/digital-contracts/liability-rules-artificial-intelligence_en): in short, a company that deploys an AI system based on a measurably biased model is liable for harm caused by the system., Conceptualizing bias as a risk factor then allows us to better understand the **shared responsibility** for machine biases between developers at all stages. Bias can never be fully removed, not least because the definitions of social biases and the power dynamics that tie them to discrimination vary vastly across social contexts. However:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Each stage of the development process, from task specification, dataset curation, and model training, to model integration and system deployment, can take steps to minimize the aspects of machine bias** that most directly depend on its choices** and technical decisions, and\\n2. Clear communication and **information flow between the various ML development stages** can make the difference between making choices that build on top of each other to attenuate the negative potential of bias (multipronged approach to bias mitigation, as in deployment scenario 1 above) _versus_ making choices that compound this negative potential to exacerbate the risk of harm (as in deployment scenario 3).]</td>\n      <td>chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>Feedback: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual.</td>\n      <td>./output/rag_chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b.json</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>64</th>\n      <td>What is the name of the open-source library created by Hugging Face to simplify Transformer acceleration?\\n</td>\n      <td>Optimum</td>\n      <td>huggingface/blog/blob/main/intel.md</td>\n      <td>The name of the open-source library created by Hugging Face to simplify Transformer acceleration is **Transformers**.\\n\\nThe context does not specify the name of the library, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.</td>\n      <td>[Last July, we [announced](https://huggingface.co/blog/intel) that Intel and Hugging Face would collaborate on building state-of-the-art yet simple hardware acceleration tools for Transformer models. \\n​, 1. **[Reformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/reformer)** (from Google Research) released with the paper [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451) by Nikita Kitaev, Łukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya., The Hugging Face Course\\n\\nThis repo contains the content that's used to create the **[Hugging Face course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1)**.

Thanks [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs)!\\n- [#5221](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5221) [`f344592a`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/f344592aeb1658013235ded154107f72d86f24e7) - Allows setting a height to `gr.File` and improves the UI of the component.  Thanks [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs)!, ### Other Changes:\\n\\n- When running on Spaces, handler functions will be transformed by the [PySpaces](https://pypi.org/project/spaces/) library in order to make them work with specific hardware. It will have no effect on standalone Gradio apps or regular Gradio Spaces and can be globally deactivated as follows : `import spaces; spaces.disable_gradio_auto_wrap()` by [@cbensimon](https://github.com/cbensimon) in [PR 4389](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4389).\\n- Deprecated `.style` parameter and moved arguments to constructor. Added support for `.update()` to all arguments initially in style. Added `scale` and `min_width` support to every Component. By [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 4374](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4374)\\n\\n### Breaking Changes:, - [#5216](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5216) [`4b58ea6d`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/4b58ea6d98e7a43b3f30d8a4cb6f379bc2eca6a8) - Update i18n tokens and locale files. Thanks [@hannahblair](https://github.com/hannahblair)!\\n- [#5283](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5283) [`a7460557`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/a74605572dd0d6bb41df6b38b120d656370dd67d) - Add height parameter and scrolling to `gr.Dataframe`. Thanks [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs)!, ```python\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        btn0 = gr.Button(\"Button 0\", scale=0)\\n        btn1 = gr.Button(\"Button 1\", scale=1)\\n        btn2 = gr.Button(\"Button 2\", scale=2)\\n```\\n\\n- `min_width` will set the minimum width the element will take. The Row will wrap if there isn't sufficient space to satisfy all `min_width` values.\\n\\nLearn more about Rows in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#row).\\n\\n## Columns and Nesting\\n\\nComponents within a Column will be placed vertically atop each other. Since the vertical layout is the default layout for Blocks apps anyway, to be useful, Columns are usually nested within Rows. For example:\\n\\n$code_rows_and_columns\\n$demo_rows_and_columns]</td>\n      <td>chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Feedback: The response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and/or not factual.

If you'd like to get started, please visit the [Optimum Intel](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel) repository, and don't forget to give it a star ⭐. You'll also find additional examples [there](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/optimization_ov). If you'd like to dive deeper into OpenVINO, the Intel [documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html) has you covered., ### OpenVINO\\n\\nBefore you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed :\\n\\n```bash\\npip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[openvino,nncf]\\n```\\n\\nIt is possible to export 🤗 Transformers and Diffusers models to the OpenVINO format easily:\\n\\n```bash\\noptimum-cli export openvino --model distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english distilbert_sst2_ov\\n```\\n\\nIf you add `--int8`, the weights will be quantized to INT8. Static quantization can also be applied on the activations using [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf), more information can be found in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/intel/optimization_ov)., | [How to run inference with OpenVINO](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/notebooks/openvino/optimum_openvino_inference.ipynb) | Explains how to export your model to OpenVINO and run inference with OpenVINO Runtime on various tasks| [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/notebooks/openvino/optimum_openvino_inference.ipynb)| [![Open in AWS Studio](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/notebooks/openvino/optimum_openvino_inference.ipynb)|, ## Optimum Intel\\n\\n### OpenVINO]</td>\n      <td>chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>./output/rag_chunk:200_rerank:False_reader-model:gemma:2b.json</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>67 rows × 9 columns</p>\n</div>"
