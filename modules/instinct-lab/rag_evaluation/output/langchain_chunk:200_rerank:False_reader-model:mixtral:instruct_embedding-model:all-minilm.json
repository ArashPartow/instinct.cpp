Furthermore, it uses a different pre-training objective\ninspired by the pre-training of [`PegasusForConditionalGeneration`].\n- LongT5 model is designed to work efficiently and very well on long-range *sequence-to-sequence* tasks where the\ninput sequence exceeds commonly used 512 tokens.

Also, by stacking attention layers that have a small\nwindow, the last layer will have a receptive field of more than just the tokens in the window, allowing them to build a\nrepresentation of the whole sentence.\n\nSome preselected input tokens are also given global attention: for those few tokens, the attention matrix can access\nall tokens and this process is symmetric: all other tokens have access to those specific tokens (on top of the ones in\ntheir local window).

[DeBERTa](model_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths.

For a task like image captioning, the model learns relationships between image embeddings and text embeddings.\n\n### Document question answering",

It presents two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training\nspeed of BERT:\n\n- Splitting the embedding matrix into two smaller matrices.\n- Using repeating layers split among groups.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:",
      "[Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft) methods freeze the pretrained model parameters during fine-tuning and add a small number of trainable parameters (the adapters) on top of it. The adapters are trained to learn task-specific information. This approach has been shown to be very memory-efficient with lower compute usage while producing results comparable to a fully fine-tuned model. \n\nAdapters trained with PEFT are also usually an order of magnitude smaller than the full model, making it convenient to share, store, and load them.",
      "However, most Transformer models continued to trend towards more parameters, leading to new models focused on improving training efficiency. [ALBERT](model_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths. It uses a combination of local windowed attention (attention only calculated from fixed window size around each token) and global attention (only for specific task tokens like `[CLS]` for classification) to create a sparse attention matrix instead of a full attention matrix.\n\n### Decoder[[nlp-decoder]]",

Also, the embedding matrix is large since it's V x E (V being the vocab size). If E < H, it has less parameters.\n- Layers are split in groups that share parameters (to save memory)."

      "In any NLP task, text is preprocessed by separating the sequence of text into individual words or subwords. These are known as [tokens](glossary#token). Token classification assigns each token a label from a predefined set of classes. \n\nTwo common types of token classification are:\n\n* named entity recognition (NER): label a token according to an entity category like organization, person, location or date. NER is especially popular in biomedical settings, where it can label genes, proteins, and drug names.\n* part-of-speech tagging (POS): label a token according to its part-of-speech like noun, verb, or adjective. POS is useful for helping translation systems understand how two identical words are grammatically different (bank as a noun versus bank as a verb).\n\n```py\n>>> from transformers import pipeline",
      "We can see that the tokenizer's special tokens `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` are mapped to `None`, and then each token is mapped to the word it originates from. This is especially useful to determine if a token is at the start of a word or if two tokens are in the same word. We could rely on the `##` prefix for that, but it only works for BERT-like tokenizers; this method works for any type of tokenizer as long as it's a fast one. In the next chapter, we'll see how we can use this capability to apply the labels we have for each word properly to the tokens in tasks like named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. We can also use it to mask all the tokens coming from the same word in masked language modeling (a technique called _whole word masking_).\n\n<Tip>",

If we want more precise segmentations, we can fine-tune a state-of-the-art segmentation model, as shown in [our previous blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-segformer). In that case, we can still use CLIPSeg to generate some rough labels, and then refine them in a labeling tool such as [Segments.ai](https://segments.ai/?utm_source=hf&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=clipseg).

It does not require the original source of the model to be run, which makes it useful for sharing or deploying with any backend that supports reading a SavedModel such as Java, Go, C++ or JavaScript among others. The internal structure of a SavedModel is represented as such:\n```\nsavedmodel\n    /assets\n        -> here the needed assets by the model (if any)\n    /variables\n        -> here the model checkpoints that contains the weights\n   saved_model.pb -> protobuf file representing the model graph\n```\n\n### How to install TensorFlow Serving?\n\nThere are three ways to install and use TensorFlow Serving:\n- through a Docker container, \n- through an apt package,\n- or using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).",

However, when you load the model file again, you may run into an error because \ud83e\udd17 Transformers may not load all the TensorFlow-related objects in the model file. To avoid issues with saving and loading TensorFlow models, we recommend you:\n\n- Save the model weights as a `h5` file extension with [`model.save_weights`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load#save_the_entire_model) and then reload the model with [`~TFPreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`]:\n\n```py\n>>> from transformers import TFPreTrainedModel\n>>> from tensorflow import keras",

Controlling the layout to keep fast access to single tensors is important.\n- No file size limit: Is there a limit to the file size ?\n- Flexibility: Can I save custom code in the format and be able to use it later with zero extra code ?

      "[Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/) is a data parallel method that shards a model's parameters, gradients and optimizer states across the number of available GPUs (also called workers or *rank*). Unlike [DistributedDataParallel (DDP)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html), FSDP reduces memory-usage because a model is replicated on each GPU. This improves GPU memory-efficiency and allows you to train much larger models on fewer GPUs. FSDP is integrated with the Accelerate, a library for easily managing training in distributed environments, which means it is available for use from the [`Trainer`] class.\n\nBefore you start, make sure Accelerate is installed and at least PyTorch 2.1.0 or newer.\n\n```bash\npip install accelerate\n```",

During the forward pass, if the CPU offload is enabled, the parameters of the local shard are first copied to the GPU/accelerator. Then, each worker performs all-gather operation for a given FSDP wrapped module/layer(s) to all get the needed parameters, computation is performed followed by releasing/emptying the parameter shards of other workers. This continues for all the FSDP modules.

However, `pickle` is not secure and pickled files may contain malicious code that can be executed. safetensors is a secure alternative to `pickle`, making it ideal for sharing model weights.\n\nThis guide will show you how you load `.safetensor` files, and how to convert Stable Diffusion model weights stored in other formats to `.safetensor`.

Note that each of these\nuse cases work for both batched and non-batched inputs (we illustrate them for non-batched inputs).\n\n**Use case 1: web page classification (training, inference) + token classification (inference), parse_html = True**\n\nThis is the simplest case, in which the processor will use the feature extractor to get all nodes and xpaths from the HTML.\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import MarkupLMProcessor",
      "feature_extractor = MarkupLMFeatureExtractor()\ntokenizer = MarkupLMTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/markuplm-base\")\nprocessor = MarkupLMProcessor(feature_extractor, tokenizer)\n```\n\nIn short, one can provide HTML strings (and possibly additional data) to [`MarkupLMProcessor`],\nand it will create the inputs expected by the model. Internally, the processor first uses\n[`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] to get a list of nodes and corresponding xpaths. The nodes and\nxpaths are then provided to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`], which converts them\nto token-level `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `token_type_ids`, `xpath_subs_seq`, `xpath_tags_seq`.\nOptionally, one can provide node labels to the processor, which are turned into token-level `labels`.",

Taken from the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08518\">original paper.</a> </small>\n\n## Usage: MarkupLMProcessor\n\nThe easiest way to prepare data for the model is to use [`MarkupLMProcessor`], which internally combines a feature extractor\n([`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`]) and a tokenizer ([`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`]). The feature extractor is\nused to extract all nodes and xpaths from the HTML strings, which are then provided to the tokenizer, which turns them into the\ntoken-level inputs of the model (`input_ids` etc.). Note that you can still use the feature extractor and tokenizer separately,\nif you only want to handle one of the two tasks.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import MarkupLMFeatureExtractor, MarkupLMTokenizerFast, MarkupLMProcessor",

WordPiece first initializes the vocabulary to include every character present in the training data and\nprogressively learns a given number of merge rules. In contrast to BPE, WordPiece does not choose the most frequent\nsymbol pair, but the one that maximizes the likelihood of the training data once added to the vocabulary.",

The model uses these IDs to identify each word.",
      ". It will understand that the words token, tokens, tokenizing, and tokenization are linked and have a similar meaning. It will also understand that tokenization, modernization, and immunization, which all have the same suffixes, are probably used in the same syntactic situations. Subword-based tokenizers generally have a way to identify which tokens are start of words, and which tokens complete start of words: token as the start of a word. ##ization as completing a word. Here the ## prefix indicates that ization is part of a word rather than the beginning of it. The ## comes from the BERT tokenizer, based on the WordPiece algorithm. Other tokenizers use other prefixes, which can be placed to indicate part of words like seen here, or start of words instead! There are a lot of different algorithms that can be used for subword tokenization, and most models obtaining state-of-the-art results in English today use some kind of subword-tokenization algorithm",
      "et's take a look at subword-based tokenization. Understanding why subword-based tokenization is interesting requires understanding the flaws of word-based and character-based tokenization. If you haven't seen the first videos on word-based and character-based tokenization, we recommend you check them out before looking at this video. Subword-tokenization lies in between character-based and word-based tokenization algorithms. The idea is to find a middle ground between very large vocabularies, large quantity of out-of-vocabulary tokens, loss of meaning across very similar words, for word-based tokenizers, and very long sequences, less meaningful individual tokens for character-based tokenizers. These algorithms rely on the following principle: frequently used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful subwords",
      "| WordPiece | This is a subword tokenization algorithm quite similar to BPE, used mainly by Google in models like BERT. It uses a greedy algorithm, that tries to build long words first, splitting in multiple tokens when entire words don\u2019t exist in the vocabulary. This is different from BPE that starts from characters, building bigger tokens as possible. It uses the famous `##` prefix to identify tokens that are part of a word (ie not starting a word).  |\n| Unigram | Unigram is also a subword tokenization algorithm, and works by trying to identify the best set of subword tokens to maximize the probability for a given sentence. This is different from BPE in the way that this is not deterministic based on a set of rules applied sequentially. Instead Unigram will be able to compute multiple ways of tokenizing, while choosing the most probable one. |",
      "```\nw ##o ##r ##d\n```\n\nThus, the initial alphabet contains all the characters present at the beginning of a word and the characters present inside a word preceded by the WordPiece prefix.\n\nThen, again like BPE, WordPiece learns merge rules. The main difference is the way the pair to be merged is selected. Instead of selecting the most frequent pair, WordPiece computes a score for each pair, using the following formula:\n\n$$\\mathrm{score} = (\\mathrm{freq\\_of\\_pair}) / (\\mathrm{freq\\_of\\_first\\_element} \\times \\mathrm{freq\\_of\\_second\\_element})$$"

Every time we would have to have asked ourselves whether the \"standard\" attention function should be adapted or whether it would have been better to add a new attention function to `attention.py`. But then how do we name it? `attention_with_positional_embd`, `reformer_attention`, `deberta_attention`?",

Then, those numbers go through the model, which outputs logits. Finally, the post-processing steps transforms those logits into labels and scores. Let's look in detail at those three steps, and how to replicate them using the Transformers library, beginning with the first stage, tokenization. The tokenization process has several steps.

      "When using PyTorch, we support TPUs thanks to `pytorch/xla`. For more context and information on how to setup your TPU environment refer to Google's documentation and to the\nvery detailed [pytorch/xla README](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/README.md).\n\nIn this repo, we provide a very simple launcher script named\n[xla_spawn.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/xla_spawn.py) that lets you run our\nexample scripts on multiple TPU cores without any boilerplate.

It can help manage the ML development cycle and potentially contribute to addressing bias by providing transparency and accountability in the modeling process.",
    "retrieved_docs": [
      "In order to better understand and address these risks, ML researchers and developers have started studying _machine bias_ or _algorithmic bias_, mechanisms that might lead systems to, for example, encode **negative stereotypes or associations** or to have **disparate performance** for different population groups in their deployment context.",
      "The first and maybe most important concept to consider when dealing with machine bias is **context**. In their foundational work on [bias in NLP](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.485.pdf), Su Lin Blodgett et al. point out that: _\u201c[T]he majority of [academic works on machine bias] fail to engage critically with what constitutes \u201cbias\u201d in the first place\u201d_, including by building their work on top of _\u201cunstated assumptions about what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why\u201d_.",
      "_This blog post from the [Ethics and Society regulars @\ud83e\udd17](https://huggingface.co/blog/ethics-soc-1) shares some of the lessons we have learned along with tools we have developed to support ourselves and others in our community\u2019s efforts to better address bias in Machine Learning. The first part is a broader reflection on bias and its context. If you\u2019ve already read it and are coming back specifically for the tools, feel free to jump to the [datasets](#i-am-curatingpicking-a-dataset-for-my-ml-system-how-can-i-address-bias) or [models](#i-am-trainingselecting-a-model-for-my-ml-system-how-can-i-address-bias)\nsection!_",
      "In the next section, we review these various stages along with some of the tools that can help us address machine bias at each of them.\n\n\n## Addressing Bias throughout the ML Development Cycle\n\nReady for some practical advice yet? Here we go \ud83e\udd17\n\nThere is no one single way to develop ML systems; which steps happen in what order depends on a number of factors including the development setting (university, large company, startup, grassroots organization, etc\u2026), the modality (text, tabular data, images, etc\u2026), and the preeminence or scarcity of publicly available ML resources. However, we can identify three common stages of particular interest in addressing bias. These are the task definition, the data curation, and the model training. Let\u2019s have a look at how bias handling may differ across these various stages.",
      "There are as many ways for the ML task definition and deployment to affect the risk of bias-related harms as there are applications for ML systems. As in the examples above, some common steps that may help decide whether and how to apply ML in a way that minimizes bias-related risk include:\n\n\n\n* Investigate:\n    * Reports of bias in the field pre-ML\n    * At-risk demographic categories for your specific use case\n* Examine:\n    * The impact of your optimization objective on reinforcing biases\n    * Alternative objectives that favor diversity and positive long-term impacts\n\n\n### I am <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">curating/picking a dataset</span> for my ML system, how can I address bias?",
      "So, who\u2019s on the hook for machine biases in ML? These three cases illustrate one of the reasons why discussions about the responsibility of ML developers in addressing bias can get so complicated: depending on decisions made at other points in the ML system development process by other people, the biases in an ML dataset or model may land anywhere between being irrelevant to the application settings and directly leading to grievous harm. However, in all of these cases, **stronger biases in the model/dataset increase the risk of negative outcomes**. The European Union has started to develop frameworks that address this phenomenon in [recent regulatory efforts](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/doing-business-eu/contract-rules/digital-contracts/liability-rules-artificial-intelligence_en): in short, a company that deploys an AI system based on a measurably biased model is liable for harm caused by the system.",
      "Conceptualizing bias as a risk factor then allows us to better understand the **shared responsibility** for machine biases between developers at all stages. Bias can never be fully removed, not least because the definitions of social biases and the power dynamics that tie them to discrimination vary vastly across social contexts. However:\n\n\n\n1. Each stage of the development process, from task specification, dataset curation, and model training, to model integration and system deployment, can take steps to minimize the aspects of machine bias** that most directly depend on its choices** and technical decisions, and\n2. Clear communication and **information flow between the various ML development stages** can make the difference between making choices that build on top of each other to attenuate the negative potential of bias (multipronged approach to bias mitigation, as in deployment scenario 1 above) _versus_ making choices that compound this negative potential to exacerbate the risk of harm (as in deployment scenario 3)."
