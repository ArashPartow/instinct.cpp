# Changelog


## v0.1.4

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/RobinQu/instinct.cpp/commits/v0.1.4

* Features
  * `instinct-assistant`: `file-search` support. It takes a summary guided strategy inspired by [RAPTOR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18059), and follows practices adopted by OpenAI. See more at [#16
    ](https://github.com/users/RobinQu/projects/1?pane=issue&itemId=58554735). It has some limitations, please refer to [#22](https://github.com/users/RobinQu/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=67421127).
  * new `instinct-transfomer` module that ships built-in models based on transformer. Currently, only [BGE-M3-Reranker](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3/tree/main) is implemented. Most code in first version implementation is refined (copied) from [chatllm.cpp](https://github.com/foldl/chatllm.cpp) for quick start.
  * `instinct-retrieval`: 
    * a new `MultiPathRetriever` that handle recalls from multiple child retrievers and score results with a reranker model.
    * `SimpleRetrieverOperator` and `DuckDBVectorStoreOpeartor` for multi-instance managements.
    * `CitationAnnotatingChain` and `SummaryChain` to support citations and summary required in `instinct-assistant`.
    * Added a mandatory `file-source` metadata field to keep record of file identifier.
  * `instinct-data`:
    * `Aggregate` method on data template class
    * Added `GetObjectState` method on `IObjectStore`.
  * `instinct-core`:
    * Added `LambdaInputParsr` and `LambdaOutputParser` to simplify chain implementation.  
    * `ManagedApplicationContext` to have more delicate lifecycle managements.
* Improvements
  * `mini-assistant`:
    * many bug fixes in related classes.
    * CLI options: we can now assign model provider separately for embedding model and chat model.
  * `instinct-core`:
    * Make options on chat model and embedding model optional using `std::optional`.
    * Fix a consistency issue of `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with the one in `langchain`.
    * Better control of preloading assets of tokenizers.
  * `instinct-server`:
    * fix graceful shutdown of `HttpLibServer`.
  * bump `duckdb` to `0.10.2`

## v0.1.3

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/RobinQu/instinct.cpp/commits/v0.1.3

Sorry for the delay. Hacking with new agent executor costs me more time than expected. But it's fun and enlightening. As a result, work on rerank models will delay to next release.

* Features
  * New `LLMCompilerAgentExecutor` as default executor in `mini-assistant`. Please see [this notebook](https://github.com/RobinQu/instinct-notebook) for evaluation results.
  * `POST /v1/threads/runs`, which is missed in last released endpoint, is added.
  * `xn::steps::branch` and `BranchStepFunction` for binary branch composing.
* Improvements
  * Migrate `instinct-lab` to [standalone repo](https://github.com/RobinQu/instinct-notebook/). Benchmarks and experimental code will be moved there.
  * Many typos in `mini-assistant` API endpoints.
  * Add more trace logs in debug mode.
  * `BaseChatModel` and `BaseLLM` supports runtime configuration with `configure(const ModelOverrides&)` method.
  * `HttpLibServer` defaults to listen `0.0.0.0`. 


## v0.1.2

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/RobinQu/instinct.cpp/commits/v0.1.2


* Features
    * First release of `mini-assistant` binary, which provides OpenAI compatible Assistant API services.
    * instinct.cpp library:
        * `instinct-core` module
            * `ChronoUtils` for datetime related functions.
            * `RandomUtils` for random number generation.
            * `SnowflakeIDGenerator` for unique ID generation.
        * `instinct-data` module
            * Data mapper classes that is built for simple ORM, with protobuf message.
            * Task scheduler abstraction and in-process task queue implementation.
            * Object store abstraction and local filesystem implementation.
        * `instinct-llm` module
            * `OpenAIToolAgentExecutor`: Agent executor based on OpenAI function calling API.
        * `insitinct-server` module
            * Error controller for `HttpLibServer` and `DefaultErrorController` implementation.
            * `HttpLibSession` struct for route handler.
* Improvements
    * `instinct-llm` module
        * function call protocol is updated to match OpenAI's standard.
        * `ILanguageModel` has `BindTools` function to support function calling API.
    * `instinct-core` module
        * Exceptions are now with stacktrace generated by `cpptrace`. 
        * assertion errors now throw `ClientException` which is sublcass of `InstinctException`.
